        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Breakfast Potato is a simple, hearty skillet dish made with potatoes and bacon—or any preferred protein—cooked to golden perfection. It's filling enough to serve as a full meal, with or without extras like bell peppers or sausages. Best made in a cast iron skillet for that perfect crisp, it can also be finished in the oven for extra crunch. The potatoes remain the true stars of this satisfying breakfast.
