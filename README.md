# ODIN RECIPES

Odin Recipes is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. Completing this project signifies a progression in the learning journey to becoming a web developer. This project marks the end of the beginner HTML. It's a commendable achieve for this learner. This documentation is the learner's attempt to reflect on the project, with an emphasis on the knowledge applied from the course. The learner's challenges are also mentioned sparingly (in some context the challenges are the focus of a section; "Git Commit Messages for instance").

## Pages
An "index.html" page lies in the root directory together with the "README.md" and a "recipes" sub-directory. The "recipes" sub-directory contains three HTML pages including:  
  1. breakfast-potatoes.html,  
  2. gizdod.html, and  
  3. nig-fried-pepper-stew,html.  

All pages contain different recipes of Nigerian origin. Credit is given to the creator of the recipes on the respective pages. Credit is also duly gievn to other sources of worthy note in the pages, as credit applies.

### A note on credits
The course recommends that credit be given to sources on the README.md page. But the learner wants to exercise his skill on links and headings, so credits are given on the site pages under a h3 heading. The learner also exercised knowledge of lists, as order lists are used to itemize the sources as the learner deems orderly.

### Takeaways
Patience is a virtue. And this is true. The learner didn't apply this turth going into the project. The assignment seems to recommend creating on recipe page then replicating it to for other recipes. The learner's failure to patiently read through the instructions cause several seconds of waste time.  

The takeawy, first, is to be patient. Second to it is to create one page for a specific topic then replicate for related topics, where it is necessary. This approach should save time, as the other pages will not require writing the structure. Instead, only contents will be placed where they should be.  

N.B.: this knowlegde is particularly for HTML, but if it may apply elsewhere, the learner will not hasitate.

## Git Commit Messages
The learner has changed his default editor to VS Code, which allows him to write clearer and detailed commit messages. Yet his commit messages are crap. Please avoid going through the commit log. You really don't want to. But the learner is aware that the expectations by peers and instructors are minimal. So, the learner has refused to allow commit messages define the learning journey. The learner is convinced that the messages will improve with time.
