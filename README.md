# ODIN RECIPES

Odin Recipes is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. Completing this project signifies a progression in the learning journey to becoming a web developer. This project marks the end of the beginner HTML. It's a commendable achieve for this learner. This documentation is the learner's attempt to reflect on the project, with an emphasis on the knowledge applied from the course. The learner's challenges are also mentioned sparingly (in some context the challenges are the focus of a section; "Git Commit Messages for instance").

## Git Commit Messages
The learner has changed his default editor to VS Code, which allows him to write clearer and detailed commit messages. Yet his commit messages are crap. Please avoid going through the commit log. You really don't want to. But the learner is aware that the expectations by peers and instructors are minimal. So, the learner has refused to allow commit messages define the learning journey. The learner is convinced that the messages will improve with time.
