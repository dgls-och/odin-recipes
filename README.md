# ODIN RECIPES

Odin Recipes is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. Completing this project signifies a progression in the learning journey to becoming a web developer. This project marks the end of the beginner HTML. It's a commendable achieve for this learner. This documentation is the learner's attempt to reflect on the project, with an emphasis on the knowledge applied from the course. The learner's challenges are also mentioned sparingly (in some context the challenges are the focus of a section; "Git Commit Messages for instance").

## Pages
An _index.html_ page lies in the root directory together with the _README.md_ and a _recipes_ sub-directory. The _recipes_ sub-directory contains three HTML pages including:  
  1. breakfast-potatoes.html,  
  2. gizdod.html, and  
  3. nig-fried-pepper-stew,html.  

All pages contain different recipes of Nigerian origin. Credit is given to the creator of the recipes on the respective pages. Credit is also duly gievn to other sources of worthy note in the pages, as credit applies.

### A note on credits
The course recommends that credit be given to sources on the README.md page. But the learner wants to exercise his skill on links and headings, so credits are given on the site pages under a h3 heading. The learner also exercised knowledge of lists, as order lists are used to itemize the sources as the learner deems orderly.

### Takeaways
Patience is a virtue. And this is true. The learner didn't apply this turth going into the project. The assignment seems to recommend creating on recipe page then replicating it to for other recipes. The learner's failure to patiently read through the instructions cause several seconds of waste time.  

The takeawy, first, is to be patient. Second to it is to create one page for a specific topic then replicate for related topics, where it is necessary. This approach should save time, as the other pages will not require writing the structure. Instead, only contents will be placed where they should be.  

**N.B.:** this knowlegde is particularly for HTML, but if it may apply elsewhere, the learner will not hasitate.

## Headings
The learner tried to apply knowledge of HTML heading tags. One h1 tag is used on pages where the need is. The learner made efforts to use h2 and h3 tags. Using h2 tags was necessitated by the instructions. But the h3 tag was used where the learner is convinced should have rather been added to the README.md documentation. Yes, the one you're reading through.

## Links
Absolute and relative links are used in the project.  

The learner uses absolute links to refer readings to original recipe site. The "rel='noreferrer' attribute is used on most pages for security and privacy. This would force the browser from sending referrer's info to the referred site. Meaning nothing should go from my site to the recipe owner's site. And a script from the recipes original sites should not be able to read my site.  

The learner also uses relative links to point site users to recipe pages from the homepage and vice versa. Links to the homepage are embedded to an unordered list item placed on top of the page. This should allow users to easily return to home should they wish to immediatly the browser renders the page.

## Git Commit Messages
The learner has changed his default editor to VS Code, which allows him to write clearer and detailed commit messages. Yet his commit messages are crap. Please avoid going through the commit log. You really don't want to. But the learner is aware that the expectations by peers and instructors are minimal. So, the learner has refused to allow commit messages define the learning journey. The learner is convinced that the messages will improve with time.
